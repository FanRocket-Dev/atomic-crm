# Contact Import

From the crm, a user can import a list of contacts via a csv file. This csv file must match the data you use to store your contacts. 
By default, we provide a sample file located at `src/contacts/contacts_export.csv`.

If you change your data structure for a contact, don't forget to modify this sample. You'll also need to modify the import function found in `src/contacts/useContactImport.tsx`
