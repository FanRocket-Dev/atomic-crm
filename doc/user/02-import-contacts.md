# Import Contacts

Atomic CRM supports bulk contact import. An exemple of the expected CSV file is available in the contact import modal.

The button to bulk import contact is available:
- On the dashboard if no contact has been imported yet, or there is no note added to any contact
- On the contact list page

When importing contacts, companies and tags will be automatically matched if they exist on the system, or imported ortherwise.
